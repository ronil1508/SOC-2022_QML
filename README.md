# SoC-2022_QML
An introduction to QC, ML and QML

## Week 1 - Introduction to QC
### What is a Qubit?
Just as a classical bit has a state either 0 or 1 a qubit also has a state. The possible states for a qubit are  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95964330/164874781-7c8f5ff1-5a00-496c-8f3c-0c8a34f5fea6.png" width=2.2% height=2.2%> and <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95964330/164912039-69f001dd-55f6-45e6-9c87-9f276af6081b.png" width=2.2% height=2.2%> . The states <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95964330/164874781-7c8f5ff1-5a00-496c-8f3c-0c8a34f5fea6.png" width=2.2% height=2.2%> and <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95964330/164912039-69f001dd-55f6-45e6-9c87-9f276af6081b.png" width=2.2% height=2.2%> are known as the computational basis state and unlike a classical bit a qubit can be in the superposition of these states. 
The general state of a qubit can be represented by <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95964330/164874629-662d2bef-87f2-4040-998a-5c9d68ef021c.png" width=20% height=20%> where alpha and beta are complex numbers and the state of the qubit is a vector of norm 1. We cannot observe and state of a qubit and this dichotomy between the unobservable state of a qubit and the observations we can make lies at the heart of quantum computation and quantum information. 
### Bloch sphere representation
In spherical co-ordinates the general state of a qubit can be written as ![Linear combination](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95964330/164911312-21d86906-97e0-4f2c-af14-f1f528ef83e5.png)
and can be represented on a sphere as shown on a Bloch Sphere:
